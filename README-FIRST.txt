Hi, welcome to this project.
This is a work of mine as it is required for a coursework for form 6. I created a website for my school, SMK Tun Abang Haji Openg. I love that school.
This is my first website after i get my hands on this coding world. :p
The file were restructure based on github default web deployment.

Originally, this website is structured by all html files in a single folder, but, since github website is a static, so, it needs to be restructured to meet the format.

To display this website, you open file "index" and open html file named as "main.html" / "main"

filepath
index > main

That's all.
